## Multiple Containers Using Docker Compose

[quote, github.com/docker/compose]
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. With Compose, you define a multi-container application in a single file, then spin your application up in a single command which does everything that needs to be done to get it running.

An application using Docker containers will typically consist of multiple containers. With Docker Compose, there is no need to write shell scripts to start your containers. All the containers are defined in a configuration file using _services_, and then `docker-compose` script is used to start, stop, and restart the application and all the services in that application, and all the containers within that service. The complete list of commands is:

[options="header"]
|====
| Command | Purpose
| `build` | Build or rebuild services
| `help` | Get help on a command
| `kill` | Kill containers
| `logs` | View output from containers
| `port` | Print the public port for a port binding
| `ps` | List containers
| `pull` | Pulls service images
| `restart` | Restart services
| `rm` | Remove stopped containers
| `run` | Run a one-off command
| `scale` | Set number of containers for a service
| `start` | Start services
| `stop` | Stop services
| `up` | Create and start containers
| `migrate-to-labels  Recreate containers to add labels
|====

NOTE: According to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ "You can run Compose on OS X and 64-bit Linux. It is currently not supported on the Windows operating system."

### Install docker compose (For Linux users)

[source, txt]
----
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.5.2/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

### Configuration File

. Entry point to Compose is `docker-compose.yml`. Lets use the following file:
+
[source, yml]
----
db:
  image: postgres
  environment:
    POSTGRES_USER: ticketmonster
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ticketmonster-docker
  net: mynet
mywildfly:
  image: rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster
  net: mynet 
  ports:
    - 8080
----
+
This file is available in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redhat-developer/docker-java/devoxxma2015/attendees/[] and shows:

.. `container_name` forces the container to have a name and hostname = `db`
.. Two services defined by the name `db` and `mywildfly`
.. Image name for each service defined using `image`
.. Environment variables for the PostgreSQL container are defined in `environment`
.. Port forwarding is achieved using `ports`
.. `net` places both containers on the same docker network called `mynetcompose`


### Create a Docker Network

As you saw in <<JavaEE_Docker_Network>> section, to allow both containers to communicate, you will need to create a docker network and use it on both containers.

. Create a new docker network

  docker network create mynet

### Start Services

. Save the `docker-compose-internet.yml` as `docker-compose.yml` if you are running from Internet or 
. Save the `docker-compose-instructor.yml` as `docker-compose.yml` if you are using images from Instructor.

. Before start the services, pull the images first.

  docker-compose pull

. All services can be started, in detached mode, by giving the command:

  docker-compose up -d

And this shows the output as:

  Creating db...
  Creating attendees_mywildfly_1...

An alternate compose file name can be specified using `-f`.

An alternate directory where the compose file exists can be specified using `-p`.

. Started services can be verified as:

[source, text]
----
> docker-compose ps
        Name                       Command               State                Ports               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
db                      /docker-entrypoint.sh postgres   Up      5432/tcp                         
attendees_mywildfly_1   /opt/jboss/wildfly/customi ...   Up      0.0.0.0:32777->8080/tcp
----

This provides a consolidated view of all the services started, and containers within them.

Alternatively, the containers in this application, and any additional containers running on this Docker host can be verified by using the usual `docker ps` command:

[source, text]
----
> docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                         NAMES
18f1933af468        postgres                         "/docker-entrypoint.s"   3 minutes ago       Up 42 seconds       5432/tcp                                      db
2328c1bdf3fc        rafabene/wildfly-ticketmonster   "/bin/sh -c '/opt/jbo"   4 minutes ago       Up 42 seconds       8009/tcp, 9990/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32777->8080/tcp   attendees_mywildfly_1
----

. Service logs can be seen as:

### Verify Application

. Access the application at http://dockerhost:32777/ticket-monster/. This is shown in the browser as:

NOTE: Use the port displayed in the `docker-compose ps` command.

### Scale Services

TODO Improve the explanation

You can scale the services up as:

  docker-compose scale mywildfly=4
  Creating and starting 2... done
  Creating and starting 3... done
  Creating and starting 4... done  
  
Check the logs...

  docker-compose logs
  
Check the running instances:

  docker-compose ps
  
[source, text]
----
       Name                     Command               State            Ports

You can also decide to reduce the number of running instances:

  docker-compose scale mywildfly=2
  Stopping attendees_mywildfly_3... done
  Stopping attendees_mywildfly_4... done
  Removing attendees_mywildfly_3... done
  Removing attendees_mywildfly_4... done

### Stop Services

Stop the services as:

  docker-compose stop
  Stopping attendees_mywildfly_1...
  Stopping attendees_mywildfly_2...
  Stopping db...

### Remove Containers

Stop the services as:

  docker-compose rm
  Going to remove afael_mywildfly_2, rafael_mywildfly_1, db
  Are you sure? [yN] y
  Removing rafael_mywildfly_2... done
  Removing rafael_mywildfly_1... done
  Removing db... done
