## Build and Deploy Java EE Application

Now that you learned a lot about images, containers and how to link them together, it is about time to learn about the different deployment options. Let's start over with the Ticket Monster applications again.
https://github.com/jboss-developer/ticket-monster[Ticket Monster] is a moderately complex application that demonstrates how to build modern applications using JBoss web technologies.

[[Build_Application]]
### Build Application
We're going to build the application first.

. Clone the repo:

  #From Internet
  git clone https://github.com/jboss-developer/ticket-monster.git 
    
  #From Instructor
  git clone http://root:dockeradmin@classroom.example.com:10080/root/ticket-monster.git 


. Build the application:

[source, text]
----
  cd ticket-monster/demo
  
  #From Internet
  mvn clean package
    
  #From Instructor
  curl http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/lab-settings.xml -o settings.xml
  mvn -s settings.xml clean package
----

### Start Application Server


Create a folder to place the deployments and give it write access

[source, text]
----
mkdir deployments
chmod a+w deployments
----

Start WildFly server as:

[source, text]
----
#From Internet
docker run --name wildfly -d -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/:rw jboss/wildfly 

#From Instructor
docker run --name wildfly -d -p 8080:8080 -v `pwd`/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/:rw classroom.example.com:5000/wildfly 
----

[NOTE]
====
Windows users need to tweak this a bit and copy the deployments to c:/Users/<USER>/deployments because the directory mappings for boot2docker work differently on those systems. Please update the docker -v argument accordingly.

'docker run --name wildfly -d -p 8080:8080 -v /c/Users/meisele/deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/:rw [classroom.example.com:5000|jboss]/wildfly'
====

This command starts a container named "`wildfly`".

The `-v` flag maps a directory from the host into the container. This will be the directory to put the deployments. `rw` ensures that the Docker container can write to it.

Check logs to verify if the server has started.

[source, text]
----
docker logs -f wildfly
----

Access http://dockerhost:8080 in your browser to make sure the instance is up and running.

Now you're ready to deploy the application for the first time.

Copy the geneated WAR to your deploy folder.

[source, text]
----
cp target/ticket-monster.war deployments/
----

Congratulations!

You've deployed your first application to WildFly running in a Docker container from JBoss Developer Studio. You can check it by looking in the logs or accessing http://dockerhost:8080/ticket-monster/

Stop WildFly container when you're done.

  docker stop wildfly
  docker rm wildfly
  

### Deploy Application Using CLI

#### WildFly

. Download WildFly 10.0.0.Final
.. from Internet: http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/10.0.0.Final/wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip .
.. from Instructor: http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip .
. Install it by extracting the archive.

#### CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for connecting to WildFly instances to manage all tasks from command line environment. Some of the tasks that you can do using the CLI are:

. Deploy/Undeploy web application in standalone/Domain Mode.
. View all information about the deployed application on runtime.
. Start/Stop/Restart Nodes in respective mode i.e. Standalone/Domain.
. Adding/Deleting resource or subsystems to servers.

Lets use the CLI to deploy ticket-monster to WildFly running in the container.

. CLI needs to be locally installed and comes as part of WildFly. This should be available in the previously downloaded WildFly. Unzip into a folder of your choice (e.g. `/Users/<USER>/tools/`). This will create `wildfly-10.0.0.Final` directory here. This folder is referred to $WIDLFY_HOME from here on. Make sure to add the `/Users/<USER>/tools/wildfly-10.0.0.Final/bin` to your $PATH.

. Run the "`wildfly-management`" image with fixed port mapping as explained in <<Management_Fixed_Port_Mapping>>.
. Run the `jboss-cli` command and connect to the WildFly instance.

Start WildFly server as:

[source, text]
----
#From Internet
docker run --name wildfly-managed -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 rafabene/wildfly-admin 

#From Instructor
docker run --name wildfly-managed -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 classroom.example.com:5000/wildfly-admin 
----

This command starts a container named "`wildfly-managed`".


[source, text]
----
./jboss-cli.sh --controller='dockerhost:9990'  -u='admin' -p='docker#admin' -c
----

This will show the output as:

[source, text]
----
[standalone@dockerhost:9990 /]
----

. Deploy the application as:

[source, text]
----
deploy <ticket-monster PATH>/target/ticket-monster.war --force
----

. Stop Wildfly

[source, text]
----
docker stop wildfly-managed
docker rm wildfly-managed
----


Now you've sucessfully used the CLI to remote deploy the Ticket Monster application to WildFly running as docker container.

### Deploy Application Using Web Console

WildFly comes with a web-based administration console. It also relies on the same management APIs that are used by JBoss Developer Tools and the CLI. It provides a simple and easy to use web-based console to manage WildFly instance. For a Docker image, it needs to be explicitly enabled as explained in <<Enabling_WildFly_Administration>>. Once enabled, it can be accessed at http://dockerhost:9990.

Username and password credentials are shown in <<WildFly_Administration_Credentials>>.

[NOTE]
====
Start a new container as `docker run -d --name wildfly-managed -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 classroom.example.com:5000/wildfly-admin`.
====

Deploy the application using the console with the following steps:

. Go to '`Deployments`' tab.

.Deployments tab in WildFly Web Console
image::images/wildfly-deployments-tab.png[]

. Click on '`Add`' button.
. On '`Add Deployment`' screen, take the default of '`Upload a new deployment`' and click '`Next>>`'.
. Click on '`Choose File`', select `<ticket-monster PATH>/target/ticket-monster.war` file on your computer. This would be `ticket-monster/target/ticket-monster.war` from <<Build_Application>>.
. Click on '`Next>>`'.
. Select '`Enable`' checkbox.

.Enable a deployment

. Click '`Finish`'.

This will complete the deployment of the Ticket Monster using Web Console. The output can be seen out http://dockerhost:8080/ticket-monster and looks like:

. Stop Wildfly
