## Build and Deploy Java EE Application

Now that you learned a lot about images, containers and how to link them together, it is about time to learn about the different deployment options. Let's start over with the Ticket Monster applications again.
https://github.com/jboss-developer/ticket-monster[Ticket Monster] is a moderately complex application that demonstrates how to build modern applications using JBoss web technologies.

[[Build_Application]]
### Build Application
We're going to build the application first.

. Clone the repo:

[source, text]
----
$ cd /root

$ git clone https://github.com/jboss-developer/ticket-monster.git 
----

. Build the application:

[source, text]
----
$  cd ticket-monster/demo
  
$  mvn clean package
    
----

### Start Application Server


Create a folder to place the deployments and give it write access

[source, text]
----
$ mkdir /deployments
$ chmod 777 /deployments
$ chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /deployments
----

Start WildFly server as:

[source, text]
----
$ docker run --name wildfly -d -p 8080:8080 -v /deployments:/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/deployments/:rw jboss/wildfly 
----

This command starts a container named "`wildfly`".

The `-v` flag maps a directory from the host into the container. This will be the directory to put the deployments. `rw` ensures that the Docker container can write to it.

Check logs to verify if the server has started.

[source, text]
----
$ docker logs -f wildfly
----

Access http://<external-ip>:8080 in your browser to make sure the instance is up and running.

Now you're ready to deploy the application for the first time.

Copy the geneated WAR to your deploy folder.

[source, text]
----
$ cp target/ticket-monster.war /deployments
----

Congratulations!

You've deployed your first application to WildFly running in a Docker container from JBoss Developer Studio. You can check it by looking in the logs or accessing http://<external-ip>:8080/ticket-monster/

Stop WildFly container when you're done.

  $ docker stop wildfly
  $ docker rm wildfly
  

### Deploy Application Using CLI

#### WildFly

. Download WildFly 10.0.0.Final from Internet: http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/10.0.0.Final/wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip .

. Install it by extracting the archive.

[source, text]
----
$ cd /root
$ wget http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/10.0.0.Final/wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip
$ unzip wildfly-10.0.0.Final.zip 
$ cd wildfly-10.0.0.Final/bin/
----


#### CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for connecting to WildFly instances to manage all tasks from command line environment. Some of the tasks that you can do using the CLI are:

. Deploy/Undeploy web application in standalone/Domain Mode.
. View all information about the deployed application on runtime.
. Start/Stop/Restart Nodes in respective mode i.e. Standalone/Domain.
. Adding/Deleting resource or subsystems to servers.

Lets use the CLI to deploy ticket-monster to WildFly running in the container.

. CLI needs to be locally installed and comes as part of WildFly. 
. Run the "`wildfly-management`" image with fixed port mapping as explained in <<Management_Fixed_Port_Mapping>>.
. Run the `jboss-cli` command and connect to the WildFly instance.

Start WildFly server as:

[source, text]
----
$ docker run --name wildfly-managed -d -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 rafabene/wildfly-admin 
----

This command starts a container named "`wildfly-managed`".


[source, text]
----
$ ./jboss-cli.sh --controller='localhost:9990'  -u='admin' -p='docker#admin' -c
----

This will show the output as:

[source, text]
----
[standalone@localhost:9990 /]
----

. Deploy the application as:

[source, text]
----
deploy /root/ticket-monster/demo/target/ticket-monster.war --force

exit
----

. Stop Wildfly

[source, text]
----
$ docker stop wildfly-managed
$ docker rm wildfly-managed
----


Now you've sucessfully used the CLI to remote deploy the Ticket Monster application to WildFly running as docker container.

### Deploy Application Using Web Console

WildFly comes with a web-based administration console. It also relies on the same management APIs that are used by JBoss Developer Tools and the CLI. It provides a simple and easy to use web-based console to manage WildFly instance. For a Docker image, it needs to be explicitly enabled as explained in <<Enabling_WildFly_Administration>>. Once enabled, it can be accessed at http://<external-ip>:9990.

Username and password credentials are shown in <<WildFly_Administration_Credentials>>.

[NOTE]
====
Start a new container as `docker run -d --name wildfly-managed -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 rafabene/wildfly-admin`.
====

Deploy the application using the console with the following steps:

. Go to '`Deployments`' tab.

.Deployments tab in WildFly Web Console

. Click on '`Add`' button.
. On '`Add Deployment`' screen, take the default of '`Upload a new deployment`' and click '`Next>>`'.
. Click on '`Choose File`', select `<ticket-monster PATH>/target/ticket-monster.war` file on your computer. This would be `ticket-monster/target/ticket-monster.war` from <<Build_Application>>.
. Click on '`Next>>`'.
. Select '`Enable`' checkbox.

.Enable a deployment

. Click '`Finish`'.

This will complete the deployment of the Ticket Monster using Web Console. The output can be seen out http://dockerhost:8080/ticket-monster and looks like:

. Stop Wildfly
