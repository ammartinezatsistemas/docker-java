- Visit each of these pages to kick-off some initial setup behind the scenes, such as enabling the Compute Engine API by navigating to Compute → Compute Engine → VM Instances

- You will see the "Compute Engine is getting ready" message. Wait until this is done.

Now, let's create our Google Compute instance.
Open the Google Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon on the top right of the screen:

Click Start **Cloud Shell**

In the Google Cloud Shell type the following command:

[source, text]
----
$ gcloud compute instances create --image-family=centos-7 --image-project=centos-cloud --machine-type n1-standard-2 --zone us-east1-b --boot-disk-size=200GB mydocker-daemon
----

This command will take some seconds to complete.

Once the command completes, you should see a Virtual Computer called "mydocker-daemon" created. Click in the SSH link.

When you click on **SSH**, a web shell will be opened. Now, we will setup our CentOS Linux to run a docker daemon.

Let's do it. Execute the following commands in the _**mydocker-daemon SSH terminal**_:

[source, text]
----
$ sudo su - 

# Installing docker and other tools 
$ yum install -y docker git wget maven unzip

$ systemctl enable docker; systemctl start docker
----

Check if the client is working by executing:
[source, text]
----
$ docker ps
----

Which will return an empty list of containers working.
