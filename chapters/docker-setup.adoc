## Setup Environments

This section describes what, how, and where to install the software needed for this lab. This lab is designed for a BYOL (Brying Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

### Hardware

. Operating System: Windows 7 (SP1), Mac OS X (10.8 or later), Fedora (21 or later)
. Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

### Environment (Just needed if you are running with Instructor support)

#### DNS Server setup Windows

Go to the adapter settings of your pc's and open the Wireless Network Connection Properties Dialogue. Edit the IPv4 Properties and add the instructor IP (!) as a primary DNS server.

Switch to the cmd and ping classroom.example.com to verify it works.

#### DNS Server setup Linux/Mac OS

. Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` (Mac OS or Linux) and leave it as:

[source, text]
----
nameserver <INSTRUCTOR IP ADDRESS>
----

[[Docker_Toolbox]]
### Docker Toolbox

The Docker Toolbox is an installer to quickly and easily install and setup a Docker environment on your computer. Available for both Windows and Mac, the Toolbox installs Docker Client, Machine, Compose, Kitematic and VirtualBox.

. What's in the toolbox:
.. Docker Client
.. Docker Machine
.. Docker Compose
.. Docker Kitematic

. Downloads are available
.. from Internet: https://www.docker.com/docker-toolbox .
.. from Instructor: http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/docker/ .


### Software

. Java: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK 8u45 or later]
. Web Browser
.. https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Chrome]
.. link:http://www.getfirefox.com[Firefox]

### Git Client

Install Git Client as explained at: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

You can find GIT for Windows at: http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/Git-2.6.2-64-bit.exe

### Maven

. Download Apache Maven...
.. from Internet: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
.. from Instructor: http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/apache-maven-3.3.3-bin.zip.
. Unzip to a directory of your choice and add it to the `PATH`.

### VirtualBox (For Linux users only)

Docker currently runs natively on Linux. It can be configured to run in a virtual machine on Mac or Windows. This is why Virtualbox is a requirement for Mac or Windows. <<Docker_Toolbox>> already includes Virtualbox but if you are a Linux user and wants to simulate multiple nodes in a Docker cluster, you must install VirtualBox.

. Downloads are available
.. from Internet: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads .
.. from Instructor: http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/virtualbox/ .

[WARNING]
====
Linux Users

. Have your kernel updated
. Users should have the GNU compiler, build and header files for your current Linux kernel
. Create a `/usr/src/linux` link to the current kernel source
====

### Docker Machine Installation (For Linux users)

Docker Machine makes it really easy to create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them.

[source, text]
----
# Linux - From Internet
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.6.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine
  
# Linux - From Instructor
sudo curl -L http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/docker/docker-machine-Linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-machine && \
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

### Create Lab Docker Host (For Windows and Mac)

. If you are running this lab without an Instructor, create the Docker Host using the following command:
[source, text]
----
docker-machine create --driver=virtualbox --engine-insecure-registry=classroom.example.com:5000 lab
eval "$(docker-machine env lab)"
----

. Or Create Docker Host to be used in the lab with an Instructor:
[source, text]
----
docker-machine create --driver=virtualbox --virtualbox-boot2docker-url=http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/boot2docker.iso --engine-insecure-registry=classroom.example.com:5000 lab

eval "$(docker-machine env lab)"
----

Use the following command on Windows:

[source, text]
----
docker-machine env lab --shell cmd
----

And then execute all the `set` commands.

. To make it easier to start/stop the containers, an entry is added into the host mapping table of your operating system. Find out the IP address of your machine:

[source, text]
----
docker-machine ip lab
----

This will provide the IP address associated with the Docker Machine created earlier.

. Edit `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` (Windows) or `/etc/hosts` (Mac OS or Linux) and add:

[source, text]
----
<IP ADDRESS>  dockerhost
----
. Check if the entry is working:

[source, text]
----
ping dockerhost
----


### Docker Client (For Linux users)

Docker Client is used to communicate with Docker Host.

[source, text]
----
# Linux - From Internet
sudo curl -L https://get.docker.com/builds/Linux/x86_64/docker-latest -o /usr/local/bin/docker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker

# Linux - From Instructor
sudo curl -L http://classroom.example.com:8082/downloads/docker/docker-latest -o /usr/local/bin/docker
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker
----

Check if the client is working by executing:
[source, text]
----
docker ps
----
Which will return an empty list of containers working. If you get an error message, make sure to have put the docker client into a folder that is contained in your path expression and that you executed the "docker-machine env lab" command according to your operatingsystem.
